# Calculator - Calculating the Sample Size of a Dataset using Statistics

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to design a program that uses statistics to help a developer select a test data (sample) set from the complete data (population) set that is expected to be processed. Design a program that takes the entire data set as the initial input, and then need to select the column / field, which represents the data point to create sample from. This calculator calculates the min, max, median, mode, mean, standard deviation, and eventually the sample size of the population.
